**App preview** below. User input a text, choose how many predictions (one to three) want to see and app does the rest.

# Description {.smaller}

Word Predict is a Shiny app that uses a text predictive algorithm to guess the next word(s) based on text already written by a user.

The application will suggest the next word in a sentence using an n-gram algorithm. An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n words from a given sequence of text.

The text used to build the predictive text model came from a large corpus of blogs, news and twitter data. N-grams were extracted from the corpus and then used to build the predictive text model.


# Predictive Model {.smaller}

The predictive model used in the app was train on the large corpus of english text from multiple sources.

The sample of data (for efficenty) was then tokenized (into n-grams) and cleaned. As part of the cleaning process the data was converted to lowercase, removed all non-ascii characters, URLs, email addresses, Twitter handles, hash tags, ordinal numbers, profane words, punctuation and white space.

When text is typed in by the user, the algorithm iterates from longest n-gram (4-gram) to shortest (2-gram) to detect a best match. The algorithm makes use of a simple back-off strategy.
